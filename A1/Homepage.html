        Your one-stop destination for all your reading needs. Explore our vast collection of books, from timeless classics to the latest bestsellers.
       Founded in 2017, our journey began with a simple dream: to make books more accessible to every reader in Egypt, from Alexandria to Aswan.Back then, we were just a small group of university friends, passionate about literature, education, and the power of storytelling. We started by selling secondhand books from a garage in Giza, connecting readers through word-of-mouth and social media. Soon, our shelves grew, and so did our community.By 2019, we launched our first website, aiming to provide a curated selection of books in Arabic, English, and French — from local Egyptian authors to international bestsellers. We built strong partnerships with publishers, local printing houses, and independent bookstores, ensuring quality, affordability, and fast delivery across the country.During the pandemic in 2020, our platform became a lifeline for students, bookworms, and lifelong learners. We introduced digital payments, expanded our delivery network, and added categories for academic textbooks, children’s stories, and rare out-of-print titles.Today, we are proud to serve thousands of customers monthly and continue our mission: to spark a reading culture and support every Egyptian’s right to knowledge.
